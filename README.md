## How You Can View My Power BI Dashboards
For those interested in actually playing around with the dashboard, here are some detailed steps to help you do so:

1. Download PowerBI

Go to this site: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/ and click the "Download Free" button in the center of the screen (this may change in the future!). There may be a prompt that asks you to download from the Microsoft Store instead, in which case simply click the button that opens the Microsoft Store and install the application from there.

Note: You DO NOT have to sign-in to use this 'Desktop' version, although if you choose to then you'll need to use a work/school email adddress.

2. Configure Some Settings

Open Power BI Desktop and simply close the large dialog window that starts. Then, go: File -> Options and settings -> Options. On the left side you'll see two general categories of options: GLOBAL and CURRENT FILE.

Under the GLOBAL options, go to 'Preview features' and de-select all options.

Under the CURRENT FILE options, go to 'Data load' and de-select the two options: (i) Update or delete relationships when refreshing data, and (ii) Autodetect new relationships after data is loaded.

Finally, again under the CURRENT FILE options, go to 'Regional Settings' and make the appropriate selection for your region.

3. Download My Project Files

Now that everything is set up, you simply have to download all my project files as they are into a folder on your machine, open the Power BI file (the one with .pbix extension) and have fun!
